I'm Ben Sehl, a Torontonian dad, and a Product Manager at Shopify. 
        
I've worked in various roles, including design, development, marketing, and strategy. I co-founded a brand called [Kotn](https://kotn.com) with my wife and oldest friend, and worked on all things digital. At Shopify, I'm working on [Hydrogen](https://h2o.shop) as a PM, trying to make it more fun to build websites. Nights and weekends, I spend time working on [Margin](https://margin.global), a premium skincare company, and push forward on some [side projects](https://incremental.studio).
