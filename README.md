I'm Ben Sehl, a Torontonian dad, and a Product Manager at Shopify. 

I've worked in various roles, including design, development, marketing, and strategy.

I co-founded a brand called [Kotn](https://kotn.com) with my wife and oldest friend, and worked on all things digital. 

At Shopify, I'm working on [Hydrogen](https://h2o.shop) as a PM, trying to make it more fun to build websites.

Occasional nights and weekends I also spend working on [Margin](https://margin.global); a premium skincare company I've partnered with my friend Drew on.

Lastly, every once in a while I also push forward on some [side projects](https://incremental.studio).
