I'm Ben Sehl. Product Director for Online Store at Shopify, and cofounder of [Kotn](https://kotn.com) and [Margin](https://margin.global). Previously, I've worked across design, development, marketing, and strategy.

Besides work, I'm a dad of two, which takes up basically all of my free timeâ€”though I try to run or strength train daily. I also like working on my home, doing yard work, and other typical dad things.
