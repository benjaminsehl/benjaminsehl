I’m Ben Sehl. A mid-thirties guy living and working in Toronto with my wife, Mackenzie; son, Emmett; and dog, Dash. 

An advocate of lifelong learning, I studied semiotics and fine arts in school, then learned from the team at Bruce Mau Design about graphic design, brand architecture, systems thinking, and how to make a polished presentation. I’ve since taken crash courses in data science, web development, product strategy, and leadership. Mostly though, I learn on my own by reading and trying stuff. 

Through my career, I’ve been a designer (of graphics, experiences, products & services), a web and software developer, a growth marketer, a brand strategist, an analytics engineer, a product manager, as well as a team leader and founder*. As a teen, I had a bunch of different jobs, and learned something from each of them—I worked in manufacturing, customer support, retail sales, landscaping, DJing, security monitoring, and ski coaching.

Most people outside of friends and family know me for co-founding [Kotn](https://github.com/kotn)—an apparel and home goods company, which I was spending all of my time on from 2014 through 2021. Now I lead product for [Hydrogen](https://github.com/shopify/hydrogen) at [Shopify](https://shopify.com). Sometimes I get to hack on [side projects](https://incremental.studio); I'm most interested in making things that improve my productivity. I also help a couple consumer brands that I like, by advising on digital strategy.
