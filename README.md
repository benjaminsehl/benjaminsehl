I’m Ben Sehl. A mid-thirties guy living and working in Toronto with my wife, Mackenzie; son, Emmett; and dog, Dash. 

An advocate of lifelong learning, I studied semiotics and fine arts in school, then learned from the team at Bruce Mau Design about graphic design, brand architecture, systems thinking, and how to make a polished presentation. I’ve since taken crash courses in data science and web development. Mostly though, I learn on my own by reading and tinkering. 

Through my career, I’ve been a designer (of graphics, experiences, products & services), a web and software developer, a growth marketer, a brand strategist and an analytics engineer, as well as a team leader and founder*. In my teenage years, I worked in manufacturing, customer support, and retail sales (not to mention landscaping, DJing, security monitoring, and ski coaching.)

Now I make a living by using my experience and perspective, centred around commerce and technology, to create products that fuel entrepreneurship.

Most people outside of friends and family know me for co-founding [Kotn](https://github.com/kotn)—an apparel and home goods company, which I was spending all of my time on from 2014 through 2021. Now I lead product for [Hydrogen](https://github.com/shopify/hydrogen) at [Shopify](https://shopify.com). Recently I’ve begun working on side-projects under the alias [Incremental Studio](https://github.com/incremental-studio). I also help a few consumer brands that I really believe in, by advising on ecommerce, analytics, and strategy—and by connecting them with great people.
