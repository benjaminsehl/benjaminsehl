I'm Ben Sehl, a Torontonian dad, and a Product Manager at Shopify. 
        
I've worked in various roles, including design, development, marketing, and strategy. I co-founded a brand called [Kotn](https://kotn.com), working on everything to do with digital and the customer experience. At the beginning of 2022 I joined Shopify, where I'm working on [Hydrogen](https://h2o.shop) as a PM, trying to make the web more fun to build. I’m also building [Margin](https://margin.global) with my friend Drew, and sometimes when my kids are napping I’ll chip away on [other ideas](https://naptime.work).
