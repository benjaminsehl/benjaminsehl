I'm Ben Sehl, a Torontonian dad, and a Product Manager at Shopify. 
        
I've worked in various roles, including design, development, marketing, and strategy. I co-founded a brand called [Kotn](https://kotn.com), handling all things digital. At Shopify, I'm working on [Hydrogen](https://h2o.shop) as a PM, trying to make the web more fun to build. Nights and weekends, I spend time working on [Margin](https://margin.global), and chip away at my [side projects](https://incremental.studio).
